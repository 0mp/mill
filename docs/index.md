Mill is your shiny new Scala build tool! Confused by SBT? Frustrated by Maven?
Perplexed by Gradle? Give Mill a try!

Mill is a general purpose build-tool. It has built in support for the
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language, and can serve as a
replacement for [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), but can also be extended to
support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java or Scala) or
through external subprocesses.

Mill aims for simplicity by re-using concepts you are already familiar with to
let you define your project's build. Mill's `build.sc` files are Scala scripts.
